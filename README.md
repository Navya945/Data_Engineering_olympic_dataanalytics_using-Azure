Welcome to the Tokyo Olympic Data Analytics Project! This repository contains the source code, documentation, and snapshots related to my recent data engineering venture on Microsoft Azure. The project focuses on analyzing Olympic data using Azure services for data engineering, storage, transformation, and analytics.

Project Highlights
Data Source: Utilized a GitHub repository with CSV files, providing a diverse set of data for in-depth analysis.

Data Ingestion: Employed Azure Data Factory to connect data sources and ingest data using the HTTP API for efficient and reliable extraction.

Data Storage: Leveraged the power of Azure Data Lake Gen2 to store and manage the enriched dataset securely within the Azure ecosystem.

Data Transformation: Implemented Azure DataBricks with PySpark for a robust data transformation process, ensuring data readiness for analytics.

Analytics: Executed sophisticated analytics on Azure Synapse, utilizing SQL scripting to derive meaningful insights from the transformed data.

Visualization: Prepared the groundwork for future visualization with popular tools like #Tableau, #PowerBI, and #Looker.
